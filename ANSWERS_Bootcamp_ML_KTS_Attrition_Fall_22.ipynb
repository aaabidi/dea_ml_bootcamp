The basic structure involves reading passages of information, and finishing exercises that are outlined for you. In some cases, there are bonus development opportunities for those that are interested. To accommodate all skill levels, here are some hotlinks that will be helpful for conducting the lab. These were sent out well ahead of time.\n",

        "**Python** will be the language with which you complete this lab. Some basic syntax and structure information is provided below. **Pandas** is Python's de-facto data management tool for data science, and relies heavily on dataframes. **Numpy** is a mathematics and linear algebra library that helps with general math operations, and **Sci-kit Learn** is Python's most basic and easy-to-use machine learning package.\n",
